Graphical Interface
------------

One method of submitting a glycan structure is through a graphical interface.  The interface used is based on the work done for GlycanBuilder with Vaadin as described in

<cite>
 Damerell D, Ceroni A, Maass K, Ranzinger R, Dell A, Haslam SM. The GlycanBuilder and GlycoWorkbench glycoinformatics tools: updates and new developments. Biol Chem. 2012;393:1357â€“1362. [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23109548).
</cite>

It is possible to create or extend embedded default structures from this interface.

  Once the structure is complete, a sequence is generated from the input and sent to the database to check if it was previously registered.  If the structure is found in the database, a link and accession number indicating the structure ID will be displayed; otherwise, a final confirmation screen will be shown. If the submit button is entered to indicate confirmation, the newly "submission ref" and graphical representation will be displayed.

As all sequences will be stored in GlycoCT (condensed) format, the sequence initially input will be displayed under _original structure_, while the sequence converted into WURCS will be displayed under _Structure_.  The image generated will be shown on the right.  This screen is necessary to confirm there are no issues in the conversion process.
