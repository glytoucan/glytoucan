Upload Interface
------------
In order to handle a bulk number of sequence registrations, the file upload interface is provided.  The sequence format restrictions are the same as the text registration interface; however another restriction is not more than 500 sequences can be uploaded at a time.  If more sequences are required, please [contact us](/team) to discuss other methods of registration.

*Not more than 500 sequences can be uploaded at a time*

Once entered, each structure will be checked for redundancy and if not previously registered, the confirmation screen will be shown.

The sequences input will be converted into WURCS and displayed on this screen.  The results on this screen can be downloaded into spreadsheet format for review.

Please note the checkbox to the left of each structure result.  As there can be multiple structures registered on this page, a checkbox is provided to choose the sequence that is to be submitted.  For those that are checked, a new Accession number will be generated and stored into the repository.
