Text Interface
------------
  Another method to query structures is via the text interface.  If the glycan structure sequence string is known, and the format is one of the following:
   
  * GlycoCT
  * IUPAC
  * KCF
  * GLYDE2
  * GlycoCT(XML)
  * LinearCode
  
the sequence can be typed or pasted into the text area input screen.

*Only one sequence can be pasted into this field.*

Once entered, if the sequence was previously registered, the confirmation screen will be shown.

_Please note that the sequence is first converted to GlycoCT, and the GlycoCT sequence is used to search for the structure_
