Text Interface
------------
  Another method to query structures is via the text interface.  If the glycan structure sequence string is known, and the format is one of the following:
   
  * GlycoCT
  * LinearCode
  * KCF
  
<br>
  
the sequence can be typed or pasted into the text area input screen.

*Only one sequence can be pasted into this field.  Please be careful of whitespace when pasting text.* 

<br>

Once entered, any related super-structures will be displayed.  If the input structure is not registered, it will indicate so as it will not have an Accession Number.

_Please note that the sequence is converted to WURCS, and the WURCS sequence is used to search for the structure_
