All glycans registered into the Glycan Repository can be easily reviewed from the Glycan browser page.

The search field provides a method to filter the scope of structures to any number of monosaccharides or motifs.

The mass range bar filters the structures to be within the maximum and minimum limits.

### Formats

There are three display formats to see the results.  The default is **list view**, where the Accession Number, Mass, Motifs, Contributor, Structural Image and Registration Date is visible.  The **WURCS view** displays each structure's WURCS sequence, Structural Image and Accession Number.  Finally the **GlycoCT view** displays each structure's GlycoCT sequence, Structural Image and Accession Number.

It is also possible to sort, in increasing or decreasing order, the results by Mass, Contributor name, Date registered, and Accession Number (the default sort setting).
