User Preferences
------------
  The User Preferences screen is where it is possible to configure the Graphical Representation of structures and Language Used for all pages of GlyTouCan.  These configurations will only last for the session that the user is logged in.

![User Preferences](/images/manual/preferences-detail.png)
  
The following Graphical Representation formats are possible:

  * Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG)
  * CFG greyscale
  * Oxford
  * Oxford colorscale
  * CFG and Oxford
  * IUPAC
  
When a representation is selected, the image structure will change to the selected format.

*Once the browser is closed or if the user session times out, this selection will no longer be in effect.  It will have to be selected again.*
