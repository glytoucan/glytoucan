Registering Your Publications
------------
You can register your publication for specific glycans in GlyTouCan under the Literature section by clicking on the "Register your Publication!" link of the selected glycan.  
<br>

On the next page the Currently Registered Literature will be shown (if any), and under this section you can enter the PubMed ID of your literature and submit.  *Note: Currently only registered PubMed IDs.* **Caution: Please make sure you are submitting the correct ID, as currently there is an [issue](https://github.com/glytoucan/glytoucan.github.io/issues/107) of no option to delete it once submitted.**  
*To clear, click on the "Reset" button.*

After clicking on submit, you will need to type in the letters and numbers in the image for security and then click on submit again.
