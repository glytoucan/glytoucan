Registering Your Publications
------------
You can register your publication for specific glycans in GlyTouCan under the Literature section by clicking on the "Register your Publication!" link of the selected glycan.  
<br>

On the next page the Currently Registered Literature will be shown (if any), and under this section you can enter the PubMed ID of your literature and submit.  *Note: Currently only registered PubMed IDs.* **Caution: Please make sure you are submitting the correct id, as currently there is no way to delete it once it is submitted.**  
*To clear, click on the "Reset" button.*
