Graphical Interface
------------

To search for a specific glycan, it is possible to build the structure through a graphical interface as shown in the figure.  The tool used is based on the work done for GlycanBuilder with Vaadin as described in

<cite>
 Damerell D, Ceroni A, Maass K, Ranzinger R, Dell A, Haslam SM. The GlycanBuilder and GlycoWorkbench glycoinformatics tools: updates and new developments. Biol Chem. 2012;393:1357â€“1362. [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23109548).

It is possible to create or extend from existing structures within this interface.

_Note: User registration is not required to query for a structure._

Once the structure is complete, a sequence is generated from the input and used to search the database for a valid id.  If the sequence is found, the structure format and any related super structures will be displayed.
