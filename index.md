<h2><a class="anchor" href="#rdf-ontology" aria-hidden="true"></a>RDF Ontology</h2>

A vast spectrum of data by the works of multiple Glycoinformatic resources are combined along with [new semantics](rdf-ontology) required by the registry.  A full description of the available data and ontologies residing in the [Semantic Web endpoint](http://ts.glytoucan.org) is also provided.

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#system-architecture" aria-hidden="true"></a>System Architecture</h2>

By incorporating the results of multiple [systems and implementations](system-structure) of other projects, the registry was able to be completed within one year of planning and development.  For the sake of sanity, all of the systems used, their source code, and project links are provided along with any planned future work.
