In preparation for the full version release coming within the next few weeks, we wanted to push onto the production server a lot of new functionality.

The bad news:  As there is a lot of infrastructural changes in this release there are still some minor bugs that are pretty obvious.  We will be quickly resolving these issues daily!

The good news:  [Substructure search](https://glytoucan.org/Structures/structureSearch) is here!  User Manuals for every page! Modern Security with HTTPs! :)

The biggest feature will have to be [Substructure search](https://glytoucan.org/Structures/structureSearch).  This is a component-based structural-analysis search working smoothly for all 40k~ structures we have registered.  The details on how this was possible will be explained in a later publication, however it really shows off the volume of data that is possible using a local RDF and some complex Sparql.  Each structure has an average of 10 residues and linkage data points, with variable sizes, ambiguity, and repetition.
