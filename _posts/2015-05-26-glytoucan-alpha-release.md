The latest release includes a vast number of updates and upgrades to our functionality.

In particular, the substructure algorithm is working for us and so it was a simple process to be able to generate the motif relationships within the registered structures.

Also, another 4000 structures were found that were in glycomedb but not registered under glytoucan.  We were able to bulk register them to bring us up over 40,000 registered structures!
