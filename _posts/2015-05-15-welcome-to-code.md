I'm very pleased to announce the release of the glytoucan code website!  This site will serve as the informational resource for everything regarding the International Glycan Repository, [glytoucan.org](http://www.glytoucan.org).

Not only will there be regular updates on this news channel, there will also be release notes, an FAQ, an index, manuals, and technical documentation covering all of the work that we've completed to make glytoucan a reality.

Please [subscribe via rss](/rss.xml) to stay in the loop, or contact us via [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/glytoucan)!
