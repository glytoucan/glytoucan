## Overview

The formal and colloquial names of glycans are an important aspect of glycobiological research.  Commonly used names are used to communicate chemical residues, monosaccharides, and structural patterns found in glycan structures.  These names can differ between languages, organizations, and research groups for the same structure or pattern.
As of this writing, there does not exist a de-facto standard for naming glycans.  Even within the cheminfo organizations, there only exist proposals of standards.

As a glycan repository, it is important for the system to be able to associate names and naming conventions to specific structures or structural patterns.  

This document describes a system architecture designed to be flexible enough to handle contributions of names used by different organizations, as well as an attempt associate the formalizing standards that are or will be used by glycan and other biochemical researchers.

### Vocabulary

To simplify the wording used for the scope of this document, please note the following definitions.

#### What is a Glycan

A glycan is any structure that can be registered into the Glycan Repository.  The smallest unit structure in this case would be a monosaccharide.  This would thus not include glycan fragments nor aglycon information.

#### What is a Structure

 A "structure" is used for any structural sequence clearly definable by the GlycoInformatic Textual Formats GlycoCT or WURCS.

#### What is a Glycan Motif

A Glycan motif is a pattern identified within glycan structures that have been associated with a specific function and thus given a name.  It is important to note that motifs need to be defined as any location of an entire glycan structure, or only connected at the root or reducing end of the tree.

#### Detailed Scenarios

Before describing a technical system workflow and data schema to support the naming of glycans, different scenarios will be described to explain the complexity of the problem.  

#### Monosaccharides

As described in the overview, the base case scenario for the glycan repository would be the registration of a monosaccharide.  [MonosaccharideDB](http://www.monosaccharidedb.org){:target="_blank"} explains this best on the [notation  page](http://www.monosaccharidedb.org/notation.action){:target="_blank"}.  MonosaccharideDB not only incorporates a primary and trivial name schema, it also defines the source of the name or the type with the 

For all new registrations, the base sequence format stored is WURCS.  As of this writing, the WURCS image generation method is still under construction so the glycoCT-based image generation in GlycanBuilder will be used primarily.  The registration process already generates KCF, glycoCT, Linearcode, and the base format WURCS, so this should not be a problem.  It should be noted that the framework should be flexible enough to replace the image generation method.  Thus how the image is generated should also be a property of the image RDF.

## Base Case

The base case is where the repository is completely blank.  In this case there is no structure nor image information.  So the entire process should start by the registration of a new structure.

## Registration

Before registration, the generation of the image is required before submitting the structure.  This is a critical aspect of the registration process, as it confirms the structure to be registered.  This is currently created by hex-encoding the image and then displayed on the browser.

The hex-encoding of the image is generated by the GlycanBuilder Library.  After confirmation, the user can submit the structure, which will then be given an accession number.

Once registered, the GlycanBuilder library is used to generate an image file in png and svg formats.  All of the glycoinformatic formats possible should be created, using CFG, IUPAC, Oxford, or any combination.

The newly registered structure will also store the related data for the image in RDF.

The glycoRDF, FOAF, schema and DC owl will be used.

glycoRDF details can be found [here](http://code.glytoucan.org/rdf-ontology/rdf-doc.html#image).

RDF for image data is covered in detail [here](http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/sw/image-rdf.html).

However there is also image data that is recognized by search engines in the [schema.org ontology](http://schema.org/ImageObject).

The ImageRdf class is used to extract the information required for these ontologies.

Here is an example of a structure ID G00054MO being registered.  Note the dc:creator and URI used specifies the program used to generate the image.

## Batch Processes

In the case of volume registrations, a batch upload process should also be considered.  This process will reuse the registration procedure to generate the image RDF for a large volume of structures.

Batch process class name:

```
org.glycoinfo.rdf.batch.image
```

## Web Service

The image binary web service will be altered so that when a specific image of an ID is requested, the RDF is checked for the binary and that data will be retrieved.  The web service will handle the parameters to find the specific format requested.

If it is not found, then a not found image will be displayed.


## Retrieval

Once the above image data is stored, it is possible to retrieve the image using sparql.

The current image web service allows for the following to display a binary image:

```
https://glytoucan.org/glycans/G00029MO/image?format=png&notation=cfg&style=extended
```
This is implemented in the following class:

```
org.glytoucan.ws.controller.GlycanController.getGlycanImage(String, String, String, String)
```

It currently retrieves the glycoct and executes the GlycanBuilder generation process to create them.

Instead the hex-encoded data can be retrieved directly using sparql.  This can then be converted into a binary image and displayed.

```
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
PREFIX dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
PREFIX glycan: <http://purl.jp/bio/12/glyco/glycan#>
SELECT ?data
WHERE {
  ?glycan glycan:has_primary_key "G00054MO" .
  ?glycan glycan:has_image ?glycanImage .
  ?glycanImage foaf:thumbnail ?data .
  ?glycanImage glycan:has_symbol_format	glycan:symbol_format_cfg ;
  ?glycanImage dc:format "image/png"^^xsd:string ;
}

```

## Conclusion

By storing the hex-encoded data directly into the RDF, the image-generation dependency and point of failure is removed.  It is also possible to alter the registration process to completely regenerate all images using a different generation program.

Once the wurcs image generation program is ready, it can be quickly integrated into this system to have a robust method of displaying structure images.
