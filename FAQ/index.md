## GlyTouCan Site

---------------

**Q.** What is GlyTouCan?<br>
**A.** Please see the [Top page](http://www.glytoucan.org/).<br><br>

**Q.** What is the meaning of GlyTouCan?<br>
**A.** GlyTouCan is the international glycan structure repository.
Thus, it is named by a combination of “Glycan” and “Tou（糖）”, which means sugar in Japanese.<br>
The word “Can” of GlyTouCan also means a can in both English and Japanese, to indicate that it is a container where glycans are accumulated. Therefore, a can is used in the logo to indicate that it is a repository with accumulated glycan data.
In addition, a toucan is used as a character since the word “Toucan” is  used in GlyTouCan.<br>
Moreover, a toucan is sitting on a branch of glycan.<br><br>

**Q.** What can we do at the GlyTouCan home page?<br>

**Q.** Do you have a tutorial on how to use this site?<br>
**A.** Please see the [User Guide](http://code.glytoucan.org/manual/).<br><br>

**Q.** What is the "reducing end" column that appears on the motif list and search pages?<br>
**A.** For motifs, this is used to determine if the root monosaccharide must be the same root for the motif-patterned structures.<br><br>

**Q.** What would happen if I don't have linkage position information?<br>
**A.** The position would be considered ambigous.  It would be registered as ambiguous and when searching, the similar structures with any linkage position will be queried.<br><br>

**Q.** How are aglycons supported?<br>
**A.** Currently aglycons and glycoconjugates are not supported.  However we do plan to support them in the near future.<br><br>

**Q.** Is there a way to filter to those glycans that have a calculated mass? <br>
**A.** Yes, currently this is supported on the [Glycan List](https://glytoucan.org/Structures) by clicking on the box to the left.<br><br>


## About Glycan Image

---------------
**Q.** Why does the image for a glycan entry not match the IUPAC string? <br>
**A.** The image generation software is currently not multi-threaded, causing the same image to appear for multiple entries due to a caching problem.  This can be resolved by right-clicking on the image, opening it in a new browser window or tab and refreshing it.  Refreshing may require holding down the control key while refreshing.<br><br>


## GlyTouCan Partner

---------------
**Q.** Want to become a GlyTouCan Partner and link your glycan structure data with us? <br>
**A.**
<br><br>

**Q.** What is a GlyTouCan partner?
**A.** The GlyTouCan partner is a partner program that enables cross-reference between GlyTouCan entry and glycan related databases id.
<br><br>

Details on GlyTouCan partner program can be found on the page
* [GlyTouCan Partner Program](http://code.glytoucan.org/partner/)
<br><br>

**Q.** Want to become a GlyTouCan Partner and link your glycan structure data with us?
**A.** You can register as a GlyTouCan partner using this google form. Cl
- For the English version.
  - [GlyTouCan Partner Registration Request (en)](http://code.glytoucan.org/partner/registration/)
- For the Japanese version.
  - [GlyTouCan Partner Registration Request (jp)](http://code.glytoucan.org/partner/registration_ja/)
<br>

 Once you have registered as the GlyTouCan partner, you can register your glycan structure data by the partner account that is registered as the partner by email.
<br>

If you register soume glycan structures with your parnte ID (glycan ID in you database),  it is necessary that you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) . The detail is describles in following page.
* [GlyTouCan Command Line Interface to API](http://code.glytoucan.org/system/cli/)
